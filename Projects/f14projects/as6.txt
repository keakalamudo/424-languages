CECS 424 Assignment 6

Count the word frequencies in as6a.txt. Erlang uses a list of tuples as a 
hash table. Write four Erlang functions.

1. This function has a string file name parameter and returns a list of 
words in the file. Open the file with file:open. The file as6a.txt was 
written in Notepad as one line so io:get_line will read the whole file. 
string:tokens will separate it into words. Its second argument specifies 
all the delimiters. 

2. This function has two parameters, a string word and a list of tuples, 
and returns a list of tuples with the word added appropriately. Each tuple 
is a word key and a frequency value. The lists:keyfind method will find a 
tuple if it exists and return false if it does not. If the word is not 
found use list construction to add a tuple with the word as key and 1 as 
the frequency. If the word is found use lists:keyreplace to replace the tuple 
with a new tuple with frequency increased by one.

3. This function has a list of words as parameter and returns a hash table 
of tuples of words and their frequencies. The string:to_lower method will 
make a word lower case to provided the desired case insensitivity.  Use 
the lists:foldl method to build the answer using the function 2.

4. This function outputs the final hash table sorted by frequency from 
high to low using the lists:sort function. Its one parameter is the file 
name. It uses functions 3 and 1.
