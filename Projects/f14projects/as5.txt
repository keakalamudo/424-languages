Erlang Functions


Write Erlang functions squares, sum, and num. 

squares has one integer parameter N and returns a list of size N of the 
squares of float random numbers, one for each position in the list.  Use 
the 
random:uniform() to generate a random number. If you want to create a seed 
that depends on the time you could use
{A1,A2,A3} = now(),
random:seed(A1, A2, A3),


sum has two list parameters of the same size. The list entries are floats. 
sum returns a list in which each element is the sum of the corresponding 
elements of the arguments.

num has a list parameter and returns an integer.  It returns the number of 
elements of the list that are less than 1.

Each function must be implemented recursively (the normal Erlang 
approach).
