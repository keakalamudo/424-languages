CECS 424 Assignment 9

Write a Clojure program to determine the word frequencies in emma.txt, the 
text of the novel Emma by Jane Austen, found on the course site. 

Write a function with two parameters, a hash table and a word that returns 
a new hash table with the word added appropriately. Use the Java 
toLowerCase method to enforce case insensitivity. If the word is not a key 
in the hash, then add it with frequency one, otherwise increase its 
frequency. Use the merge-with function. (Actually you are creating a new 
table with these changes.)

Write a function with one parameter, the file name whose words we are 
counting. The slurp function will read the file into a string.
Use the re-seq function with two arguments, a regular expression [a-zA-Z]+ 
and the string just created. It will return a lazy sequence with only the 
characters selected, omitting punctuation, numerals, and whitespace. Use 
the 'reduce' function with the first function you wrote and the sequence 
of words just created starting with an empty hash {} to create the hash 
table of frequencies. Use the sort-by function with the key function 
'last' and the '>' operator to sort by frequency from high to low. Use the 
spit function to output the result to a file. 

Copy the ten most frequent words, with their frequencies, from the file.

The program is three or so lines long and runs quite quickly.
