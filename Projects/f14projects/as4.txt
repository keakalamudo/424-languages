methods and blocks

Write a Ruby method with a variable number of arguments that returns an 
array of all arguments which are strings containing at least two vowels.

Write a Ruby method to find the primes up to a parameter passed to it. Use 
a block to display these values. The method creates an array of numbers 
from two up to the parameter value.  While the first number in the array 
is less than the square root of the parameter, it yields that first number 
and removes all multiples of it from the array.  When the test is done all 
remaining numbers are prime and must be yielded to the block so they will 
be displayed..
