Clojure Functions

Write Clojure functions squares, sum, and numberOf. Do not use recursion. 
Use higher-order functions map and filter. 

squares has one integer parameter N and returns a list of size N of the 
squares of float random numbers, one for each position in the list.  Use 
rand to generate a random number. The repeatedly function will repeatedly 
call a function of no arguments. The take function has two arguments an 
integer and a collection. It will return the number of elements of the 
collection specified by the integer parameter.

sum has two list parameters of the same size. The list entries are floats. 
sum returns a list in which each element is the sum of the corresponding 
elements of the arguments.

numberOf has a list parameter and returns an integer.  It returns the 
number of elements of the list that are less than 1.
