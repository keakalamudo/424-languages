CECS 424 Assignment 1

Write a Ruby program for the following. There are six possible letters a, 
b, c, d, e, and f.  Input four letters for a pattern, and they may be 
repeated, so they might be abcc or aadd, etc.  Then enter a test string of 
four letters, say ddec. The computer returns two numbers, the number of 
letters that exactly match the pattern chosen in advance, and the number 
of letters that are in the pattern but that the user put in the wrong 
position.  For example, if the pattern is abcc, some guesses and scores 
are:
                 adef     1, 0
                 deaf     0, 1
                 cabb     0, 3
                 cccc     2, 0
                 acbc     2, 2
